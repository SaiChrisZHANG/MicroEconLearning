The first chapter summarizes the basic setting of individual decision making: preferences, choices and utilities. The main reference is Chapter 1 of \citet{mas1995microeconomic}.

In this chapter, we will focus on 3 domains: 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
    \hline
    \textbf{choice} & given a set $A$, what choice from $A$ is made \\ 
    \textbf{preference} & given alternatives $x,y$, which does the decision maker prefers \\ 
    \textbf{utility} & given an object $X$, how much does the DM likes $X$ (as a number)\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The starting point of individual decision problem is a \textit{set of possible (mutually exclusive) alternatives} from which the individual must choose. To model decision making process
on this set of alternatives, one can:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] either start from the tastes, i.e., \textit{preference relations} of individuals, and set up the patterns of decision making with preferences
    \item[-] or, start from the actual actions of individuals, i.e. \textit{choices}, to deduct a pattern of decision making
\end{enumerate}

With this two major approaches in mind, we know what's coming: the \textit{\textbf{rationality}} of preferences and the central assumption of choices, the \textbf{\textit{Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP)}}.
And of course, the two approaches and two basic assumptions are parallel, so we need to figure out how link the (underlying) preferences and (observed) choices.
