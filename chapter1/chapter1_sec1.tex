We start from the basic: \textit{weak preference relation}, $\succsim$.
\begin{definition}\label{def_succsim}
    A weak preference relation $\succsim$ on a set $X$ is a subset of $X\times X$. If $(x,y)\in \succsim \Rightarrow$ $x$ is at least as good as $y$, written as $x\succsim y$
\end{definition}

A weak preference relation will induce two other types of relations on $X$:
\begin{definition}\label{def_succ_and_sim}
    With $\succsim$ defined by Def. \ref{def_succsim}, we have
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[-] the \textit{strict preference relation}, $\succ$ can be induced from $\succsim$ as: $x\succ y\Leftrightarrow x\succsim y \land y\not\succsim x$,
        or in words, $x$ if preferred to $y$.
        \item[-] the \textit{indifference relation}, $\sim$ can be induced from $\succsim$ as: $x\sim y \Leftrightarrow x\succsim y \land y\succsim x$, or in words, $x$ is indifferent to $y$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

With the definition of these relations, we now define the central assumption of relations: \textit{\textbf{rationality}}. 
\begin{definition}\label{def_succsim_rational}
    A weak preference relation $\succsim$ is \textit{rational} if it is:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[-] Complete: $\forall x,y\in X$, $x\succsim y$ or $y\succsim x$ or both 
        \item[-] Transitive: $\forall x,y,z\in X$, $x\succsim y\land y\succsim z\Rightarrow x\succsim z$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

How to understand them? They are both strong assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] Completeness of $\succsim$ means it is well-defined between any two possible alternatives. From the perspective of an individual, completeness means that she will make choices, and only meditated choices.
    \item[-] Transitivity of $\succsim$ implies that the decision maker will not have a preference cycle, since whoever has a preference cycle would suffer economically for it\footnote{There are 2 types of violations of 
    transitivity: irrational and mechanical. Irrational violations are easy to understand: decision makers simply do not follow transivity assumption. Mechanical violations means that decision makers are "forced" to violate transitivity. One 
    example of this type of violation is aggregation of considerations: decision makers may aggregate several sub-preferences as together to make the choice, leading to violation of transitivity. Another example is when the preference
    is only defined for differences above a certain level. See \citet[Page 4-5]{ariel2012lecture} for details}.   
\end{enumerate}
