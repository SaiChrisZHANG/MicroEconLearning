For the welfare analysis, the goal is to determine the welfare change for a change in price from $\mathbf{p}^0$ to $\mathbf{p}^1$.

The key object used for welfare analysis is \myhl[blue!45!black]{\textbf{money metrics}}, which is built on the expenditure function: $e(\bar{\mathbf{p}},v(\mathbf{p},w))$. This expenditure function is \textbf{strictly increasing} in $v(\mathbf{p},w)$, hence is also an indirect utility function (a monotonic transformation).
