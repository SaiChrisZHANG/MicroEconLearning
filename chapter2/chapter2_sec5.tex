For the welfare analysis, the goal is to determine the welfare change for a change in price from $\mathbf{p}^0$ to $\mathbf{p}^1$.

The key object used for welfare analysis is \myhl[blue!45!black]{\textbf{money metrics}}, which is built on the expenditure function: $e(\bar{\mathbf{p}},v(\mathbf{p},w))$. This expenditure function is \textbf{strictly increasing} in $v(\mathbf{p},w)$, hence is also an indirect utility function (a monotonic transformation).

With the expenditure function, we can construct two measures of welfare change:
\begin{definition}{Two Welfare Change Measures}{welfare_change}
    Let $u^0 = v(\mathbf{p}^0,w)$, $u^1 = v(\mathbf{p}^1,w)$, 
\end{definition}
