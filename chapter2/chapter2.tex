The second chapter focuses on the most fundamental decision unit of microeconomic theory: \textit{consumer}. The main reference is Chapter 2 and 3 of \citet{mas1995microeconomic}.

The basic setting of consumer demand study is \textit{market economy}, where the goods and services that the consumer may acquire and consume are available for purchase at known prices (or trade for other goods at know exchange rates).

In this chapter, we will focus on 2 major aspects of the consumer theory: choice and demand.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
    \hline
    \textbf{choice} & individual decision making based on choice\\ 
    \textbf{demand} & individual decision making induced by preference \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The starting point of individual decision problem is a \textit{set of possible (mutually exclusive) alternatives} from which the individual must choose. To model decision making process
on this set of alternatives, one can:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] either start from the tastes, i.e., \textit{preference relations} of individuals, and set up the patterns of decision making with preferences
    \item[-] or, start from the actual actions of individuals, i.e. \textit{choices}, to deduct a pattern of decision making
\end{enumerate}

With this two major approaches in mind, we know what's coming: the \textit{\textbf{rationality}} of preferences and the central assumption of choices, the \textbf{\textit{Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP)}}.
And of course, the two approaches and two basic assumptions are parallel, so we need to figure out how link the (underlying) preferences and (observed) choices.

For the content of this chapter, my main reference is Chapter 1 of \citet{mas1995microeconomic}. Section 1, Chapter 2 of \citet{kreps1990acourse} covers similar content but starts from strict preference $\succ$, it is a very
good complement to \citet{mas1995microeconomic}. Chapter 1 of \citet{kreps2013microeconomic} explores choice and preferences on infinite sets. Lecture 1 and 2 of \citet{ariel2012lecture} give a well organized, lecture-structured summary of
these contents, it is a very good read.
